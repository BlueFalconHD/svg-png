## üõ† Technologies

Project was built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **VanillaJS** but what is it?

- **HTML** - Or HyperText Markup Language, which means: "Hypertext Markup Language" is a markup language used in the construction of the "skeleton" of web pages.

- **CSS** - Or Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding style to a web document.

- **VanillaJS** - Nothing else is pure JavaScript. The play on the name probably arose from the English expression ‚Äúvanilla (something)‚Äù, which refers to the most common or simplest version of something.
